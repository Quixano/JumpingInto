# JumpingInto
This is where I'll put completed excercises from the book "Jumping Into C++" by Alex Allain.
Exercises are set up in "Chapter-Exercise" format.

All of them were written in Notepad++, then compiled with CodeBlocks with the GNU GCC Compiler. All files have been built and verify that they run.
